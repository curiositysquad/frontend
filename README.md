Welcome to our minimalist approach at a full-stack application as a group!

This application is a simple and sleek take on a Todo-List. We did not pull inspiration whatsoever from [Momentum](momentumdash.com).

## Technologies Used
* React
* Location Services API
* Weather API

## Our Approach

When Tasked with creating a full stack application using **React** and **Ruby** on **Rails** nonetheless as a group, we were originally worried about what would build. Upon going over the requirements a few more times we came to the conclusion that our task was not so complex. We would begin with tackling a full **C.R.U.D.** application, something basic - and thus we decided on a Todo list. We looked to the Momentum add-on for google chrome for inspiration as it was just that, a todo list. We then added in a couple stretch goals (see; weather and location) to spice things up a bit. We then built out a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/eWeVnh9m/project-4) to organize our thoughts and workflow. 

**Responsibilities**

We divied up the tasks as such:
* Back-End Lead - Keneisha C.
* Front-End Lead & Release Manager - Peter G.
* Product Manager & dev support - Tyler F

**Execution**
The 'rough' list of steps taken was then:
* Repositories made, collaboration added
* Back-End built
* Front-End containing basic CRUD with no styling built
* Working MVP was then tested and deployed!
* Implementation of the location service API
* Time clock feature added
* Weather indicator added
* tears wept
* presentation

## Dev Notes
* Full CRUD is our MVP, however the API's are **not**, the order of the problems relates to their priority.
